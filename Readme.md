# CHGK Django

### Description
---

What? Where? When? (CHGK, if with translit) is a well-known TV show, however very few know about the so-called sport version of this game. Each week teams all over the world can select tournaments to play. Many teams can play at the same place at the same time. After the game, results are published by the responsible person to a special site. Site contains info about all players and teams with their ratings and also about all games. This [site](https://rating.chgk.info/) is a real prototype of this project.

Project maintains main functionality. Info about teams, players and tournaments is available for all visitors. In order to play, one person must register the place where the game will be held. He must appoint another person (or, maybe, himself) as a question reader. Question reader receives an email with a question document. Person who registers is also responsible for uploading all results. Results must be uploaded as files of Excel format. 

Tournaments are of two types: regular and cups. Regular tournaments are held each week, teams can choose any day during the week to play. Teams from all over the world can compete with each other since all results are combined together. Cup is the tournament which is held at one place at one time (like festivals or country championships).

When the tournament is over and all results are gained, teams and players get some rating points according to their position in the resulting table.
